title: "Error Codes"
description: "The Router API performs various validations and simulations to ensure that transactions are safe and executable before returning calldata. If a request fails validation or simulation, the API responds with a standardized error format."
---

## Error Format
All errors follow the structure below:
```json
{
  "statusCode": <HTTP status code>,
  "error": "<Error message>"
}
```

---

## Common Error Responses

### 1. Simulation Failure
If the transaction fails during pre-trade simulation (to prevent on-chain reverts), the API will return:
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "error": "Unable to fetch a solution for the user request"
}
```
**Cause:** The router was unable to find a valid routing path or execution strategy that would succeed based on the current market conditions, balances, or configuration.

### 2. Invalid Network ID
If the request contains a network ID that is unrecognized or unsupported, the API will return:
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "error": "Invalid networkID provided."
}
```
**Cause:** The `networkID` value is missing, malformed, or not supported by GlueX.

## Additional Guidance
- Always validate tokens, amounts, and network details on the client side before submitting a request.
- Use the `/liquidity` endpoint to fetch supported networks and modules.
- Regularly monitor response codes and apply proper error handling for better UX.
