## Rate Limits and Access Tiers

To ensure the stability, reliability and equitable access of the Router API for all users, we implement a system of rate limits organized into distinct access tiers. These limits protect our infrastructure from abuse, manage system load efficiently and guarantee a high quality experience even during peak demand. Each access tier offers a specific API request rate, burst capacity and a corresponding level of support, tailored to different development and production needs

### Access Tiers Overview

| Tier           | Requests Per Second (RPS) | Burst Capacity | Use Case                                                                                                                                                |
| :------------- | :------------------------ | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Basic**      | 3                         | 3              | Ideal for initial development, proof of concept projects, testing and small scale application with infrequent API calls                                 |
| **Growth**     | 10                        | 30             | Suitable for mid sized production application, services and applications with moderate user traffic                                                     |
| **Premium**    | 20                        | 50             | Designed for large scale production applications, real time trading interfaces and platforms requiring consistent high throughput                       |
| **Enterprise** | Custom                    | Custom         | Tailored solutions for high volume exchanges, large scale aggregators, institutional trading desks and partners with unique infrastructure requirements |

### Understanding RPS and Burst Capacity

- **Requests Per Second (RPS):** This is the **sustained rate** at which your application can make API calls over a longer period. For example, a tier with 3 RPS can make, on average, 3 requests every second
- **Burst Capacity:** This represents the **maximum number of requests** your application can send in a very short spike _above_ its sustained RPS limit before hitting a rate limit error. It acts as a buffer to absorb sudden, short term surges in traffic. Once the burst capacity is depleted, requests will be throttled back to the sustained RPS rate until the bucket refills

## How to Upgrade Your Tier

As your application scales and your API usage grows, GlueX offers seamless tier upgrades to meet your evolving demands. Higher tiers unlock significant advantages, including increased API throughput, enhanced reliability guarantees and dedicated support

Partners interested in upgrading their access tier are encouraged to reach out directly to the **GlueX team** via our [official Telegram channel](https://t.me/+_VmO_gIrNjxiZWE0). During this process, we will discuss your specific needs, projected API usage and provide tailored solutions

> ⚠️ **Important Note on Endpoint Usage**
>
> To maintain platform stability and ensure optimal performance for all users, GlueX enforces **stricter rate limits on high computation endpoints**, specifically `/v1/quote`. The `/v1/quote` endpoint performs intensive onchain simulations, which are resource heavy
>
> Conversely, the `/v1/price` endpoint is designed to be lightweight and highly performant for frequent polling. It provides rapid price estimates without deep onchain simulation
>
> **Best Practice:**
>
> - **`/v1/price`** should be the **primary endpoint used in your application** for displaying real time indicative prices and general market information
> - **`/v1/quote`** should be called **only when a user is ready to execute a swap** and requires precise, executable transaction data.
>
> Adhering to this practice will help you stay within your rate limits and ensure a smooth user experience

### Benefits of Higher Tiers

- **Increased Rate Limits:** Access significantly higher RPS and burst capacities to support larger user bases and more demanding applications
- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Enterprise and Premium tiers often come with formal SLAs, guaranteeing specific uptime, performance metrics and response times for critical issues
- **Priority Support:** Receive expedited assistance from our technical team, ensuring your queries and issues are addressed promptly
- **Custom Integration Guidance:** Benefit from dedicated technical consultations and integration support to optimize your application's performance and integrate the features effectively
- **Custom Pricing and Billing:** For Enterprise partners, flexible pricing models can be arranged to align with your business operations
