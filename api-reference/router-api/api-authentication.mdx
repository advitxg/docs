title: "API Authentication"
description: "Authentication is required for all interactions with the GlueX Router API. This ensures secure access, usage tracking, and integration-specific rate limits."
---

## Step 1: Login to the GlueX Portal

To begin, navigate to the official GlueX Portal:

ðŸ‘‰ [https://portal.gluex.xyz/](https://portal.gluex.xyz/)

Log in with your registered credentials to access your integration dashboard.


## Step 2: Retrieve Your Credentials

After logging in:
1. Navigate to the **"Keys"** page in the portal.
2. Copy the following values:
   - **API Key** (`x-api-key`)
   - **Integrator ID** (`uniquePID`)

These values are essential for making authenticated API requests.

## Step 3: Use Credentials in API Calls

### Headers
Include the API key in every request header:
```http
x-api-key: your-api-key
```

### Request Body
Include your integrator ID as the `uniquePID` parameter in the body of each request:
```json
"uniquePID": "your-integrator-id"
```

### Example Request
```http
POST /v1/price
Host: https://router.gluex.xyz
x-api-key: your-api-key
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
  "chainID": "ethereum",
  "inputToken": "0x...",
  "outputToken": "0x...",
  "inputAmount": "100000000",
  "userAddress": "0x...",
  "outputReceiver": "0x...",
  "uniquePID": "your-integrator-id"
}
```

## Step 4 (Optional): Whitelist Domains

GlueX provides the option to restrict the usage of your API key to specific domains for added security. This is especially useful for frontend integrations.

### To configure:
- Go to the **"Keys"** page in the GlueX Portal
- Select your API key
- Add the domains you want to whitelist (e.g., `gluex.xyz`)

Requests originating from unlisted domains will be rejected, helping you prevent unauthorized use of your key.
