If you’re experiencing any issues with the integration or APIs, please follow these initial troubleshooting steps:

<Steps>

    <Step title="Verify the keys">
    Verify your keys by ensuring the headers are correctly set for all the
    **authenticated requests** and check in the GlueX portal that your **key is
    active** and has not been revoked or rotated
    </Step>

    <Step title="Confirm Endpoints">
    Ensure you are targeting the correct environment by verifying the base URL.
    Production endpoints are `https://router.gluex.xyz` for quotes and
    `https://exchange-rates.gluex.xyz` for exchange rates
    </Step>

    <Step title="Validate Request Payload">
    Confirm the payload matches the schema ensuring all required fields are set
    and all the data matches the expected types
    </Step>

    <Step title="Inspect HTTP Status Codes">
    Examine the HTTP status code returned by the API. A `400` indicates a
    malformed request, `401`/`403` indicate authentication or authorization
    failure, `429` signals rate limiting and any `5xx` indicates a server side
    error
    </Step>

    <Step title="Review Rate Limits">
    Verify that you are within your allowed request rate to avoid throttling. If
    you receive `429` responses, implement exponential backoff and reduce request
    frequency
    </Step>

    <Step title="Confirm Token Addresses and Chains">
    Make sure the token contract addresses exist on the specified chain and are
    correctly checksummed
    </Step>

    <Step title="Enable Debug Logging">
    Turn on verbose logging in your client or SDK to capture full request and
    response details, including headers and bodies. Look for hidden error messages
    or stack traces in the logs
    </Step>

    <Step title="Gather Logs and Contact Support">
    If the issue persists, collect timestamps, full request/response pairs, and
    error details. Reach us out via [telegram](https://t.me/+6NrwSlEPAsA3MzE0) or Open a
    support ticket via [discord](https://discord.com/invite/gluex) with your findings
    and a summary of the steps you’ve tried
    </Step>

</Steps>

If the problem persists after following the steps above, please let us know immediately via our Telegram channel or Discord server (you can find the links to these channels [here](https://bento.me/gluex-protocol)). When opening a new support thread, include the demo URL, the exact HTTP request and response (headers, body, status code), timestamps and a brief description of what you’ve tried so far. It’s also helpful to search existing Telegram and Discord conversations, chances are someone else may have already found a solution that can help you more quickly
