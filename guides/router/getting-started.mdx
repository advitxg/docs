## 1. Register on the GlueX Developer Portal

To begin using the GlueX Router API, developers must register via the official GlueX partner portal.

#### Steps:
1. Visit the [GlueX Developer Portal](https://portal.gluex.xyz/login)
2. Complete the onboarding form to register your application or project.
3. Upon login, you will receive:
   - A unique `x-api-key` (API Key)
   - A `uniquePID` (Partner Identifier)

These credentials must be included in all Router API requests.


## 2. Fetch Available Liquidity

Before initiating any trade, it is important to verify which chains and liquidity modules are supported.

#### Endpoint:
```http
GET /liquidity
```

#### Description:
Returns supported chains and liquidity modules, which help optimize your routing logic.


## 3. Estimate Swap Using `/v1/price`

Use the `/v1/price` endpoint to obtain a real-time estimate for a token swap. This request should be frequently polled in dApps to show users updated price quotes.

#### Headers:
```http
x-api-key: your-api-key
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### Key Fields:
- `inputToken`, `outputToken`
- `inputAmount` or `outputAmount`
- `userAddress`, `outputReceiver`
- `uniquePID`

## 4. Approve Token Transfer

Before the router can execute the swap, users must approve the router contract to spend the input token.

### Optional: Permit2
GlueX supports Permit2 token approvals. Enable by setting:
```json
"isPermit2": true
```

## 5. Obtain Calldata Using `/v1/quote`

Once the user confirms the swap and approvals are in place, call the `/v1/quote` endpoint to get the calldata required to execute the trade on-chain.

### Response Includes:
- `calldata`: ABI-encoded transaction data
- `routerAddress`: Contract to send the transaction to
- Gas and simulation estimates

## 6. Execute the Swap On-Chain

Submit the calldata from `/v1/quote` to the router contract. This transaction must be signed by the user and sent to the blockchain for final execution.

### Final Steps:
- Use a web3 library like `ethers.js` or `web3.js`
- Send transaction to the router contract address with the specified `value`
- Monitor the transaction for success
