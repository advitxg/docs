## Overview

This tutorial walks you through fetching on-chain exchange rates for any token pairs using the GlueX Exchange Rates API.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Request

The API expects a POST request with a JSON body specifying the token pairs and blockchains.

```json
[
  {
    "domestic_token": "tokenA-address",
    "foreign_token": null,
    "domestic_blockchain": "blockchain_id_1",
    "foreign_blockchain": "blockchain_id_1"
  },
  {
    "domestic_token": "tokenB-address",
    "foreign_token": "tokenC-address",
    "domestic_blockchain": "blockchain_id_2",
    "foreign_blockchain": "blockchain_id_2"
  }
]
```

## Step 2: Make the Request

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST "https://exchange-rates.gluex.xyz" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"domestic_token": "tokenA-address", "foreign_token": null, "domestic_blockchain": "blockchain_id_1", "foreign_blockchain": "blockchain_id_1"}, {"domestic_token": "tokenB-address", "foreign_token": "tokenC-address", "domestic_blockchain": "blockchain_id_2", "foreign_blockchain": "blockchain_id_2"}]'
```

### Using Python

```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://exchange-rates.gluex.xyz"
data = [
    {
        "domestic_token": "tokenA-address",
        "foreign_token": None,
        "domestic_blockchain": "blockchain_id_1",
        "foreign_blockchain": "blockchain_id_1",
    },
    {
        "domestic_token": "tokenB-address",
        "foreign_token": "tokenC-address",
        "domestic_blockchain": "blockchain_id_2",
        "foreign_blockchain": "blockchain_id_2",
    }
]
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
print(response.json())
```

## Step 3: Handle the Response

The response will contain a list of exchange rates for the requested token pairs.

```json
[
  {
    "domestic_token": "tokenA-address",
    "price": 0.00010741495276069063,
    "foreign_token": "blockchain_id_1_native-currency-address",
    "domestic_blockchain": "blockchain_id_1",
    "foreign_blockchain": "blockchain_id_1"
  },
  {
    "domestic_token": "tokenB-address",
    "price": 1.0013751780636744e-12,
    "foreign_token": "tokenC-address",
    "domestic_blockchain": "blockchain_id_2",
    "foreign_blockchain": "blockchain_id_2"
  }
]
```

You're ready to integrate real-time exchange rates into your app!
