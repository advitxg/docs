## Exchanges

Build fully featured, high performance trading platforms (centralized, decentralized or hybrid) without reinventing the routing layer. GlueX handles order aggregation across DEXs and AMMs, advanced pathfinding for best price, slippage protection and onchain settlement. Out of the box support for market orders, custom fee tiers and pegged orders lets you launch a complete exchange in days, not months

## Marketplaces

Whether you’re selling NFTs, ingame items or tokenized real world assets, add instant payment routing so buyers can pay in any token and sellers receive their preferred asset. GlueX transparently swaps between payment and payout tokens, hides gas complexity behind a single UX, and ensures you capture volume through optimized routing

## Wallets

Integrate in app swaps so your users never leave their wallet interface. With a single API call you can quote, approve and execute trades, all in a gas efficient manner. Provide one click token bridging, auto routing across chains and personalized slippage settings. Ideal for custodial, non custodial and browser extension wallets

## DeFi Protocols

Enhance lending, borrowing, leverage and yield farming protocols by plugging in best price swap functionality. Use GlueX as the settlement layer for collateral swaps, liquidation auctions, or protocol rebalancing. Combine with your own smart contract logic for composable, gas-optimized flows

## Social & Consumer Apps

Add token tipping, peer to peer swaps, or community lotteries to social networks, streaming platforms or content apps. GlueX’s simple embeddable components handle quotes, approvals and execution so you can focus on UX, engagement and community features

## AI Agents

Power autonomous trading bots and onchain AI agents that monitor market conditions and execute strategies in real time. GlueX’s low latency quote API and smart routing ensure your agents always get the best fill, whether they’re arbitraging across chains or implementing market making strategies

## DeFi Automation

Create automated and conditional flows such as recurring buys, portfolio rebalances, stop loss triggers, and more. Combine our SDK with your task scheduler to define events like “if ETH drops below $1,900, swap USDC to ETH” Automate complex strategies without maintaining your own routing infrastructure
