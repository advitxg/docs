# Preparing for Production

Congratulations on building your DeFi application with GlueX!

Before you launch your integration to a live audience, it's essential to follow a robust go live process. This checklist will guide you through the critical steps to ensure your application is secure, performant and ready for real world usage

### Review Integrator Settings

Before going live, verify all your GlueX account settings are configured for a production environment. This involves more than just a quick glance

- **Access the Dashboard**: Log in to the [GlueX developer portal](http://portal.gluex.xyz/)
- **Key Management**: Generate new and dedicated API keys for your production environment distinct from your development/testing keys and should be treated as highly sensitive
- **Whitelist Domains**: Ensure your production server's domain or IP addresses are whitelisted for the API key (defaults to all domains)
- **Billing and Payment**: Ensure your payment information is up to date and your chosen plan aligns with your expected production usage to prevent service interruptions

### Secure the Keys

Protecting your production API keys is paramount to your application's security

- **Environment Variables**: Never hardcode API keys directly into your codebase. Use environment variables (eg: `GLUEX_API_KEY`) that are loaded securely at runtime
- **Secret Management**: For enhanced security, consider using dedicated secret management services to store and retrieve your production keys
- **Restrict Access**: Implement strict access controls, ensuring only authorized personnel and your production servers/services can access these keys
- **Test Authentication**: After swapping to live keys, perform a basic API call to confirm successful authentication

### Implement Information Capture

Comprehensive logging and monitoring are crucial for diagnosing issues, tracking performance, and understanding user behavior in a live environment

- **Detailed Logging**: Implement thorough logging for all requests and responses within your application (include request parameters, full response data, timestamps and any error messages for better debugging)
- **Error Reporting**: Configure an error tracking system to automatically capture and alert you to any unhandled exceptions

### Finalise the Plan

Choosing the correct GlueX plan ensures you have the necessary capacity and features for your live application

- **Estimate Usage**: Based on your testing and projected user base, accurately estimate your anticipated API call volume, transaction volume and feature requirements
- **Review Pricing Tiers**: Familiarize yourself with GlueX's current pricing plans and their associated benefits (rate limits, dedicated support, advanced features)
- **Select Appropriate Plan**: Choose the plan that best matches your estimated usage and business needs

### Understand Rate Limits

To maintain service stability, GlueX implements API rate limits. Understanding and planning for these is vital for uninterrupted operation.

- **Review Limit Documentation**: Check the API documentation for the specific rate limits associated with your chosen production plan
- **Implement Retry Logic**: Integrate retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to gracefully handles `429 Too Many Requests` errors by retrying calls after increasing intervals
- **Monitor Usage**: Utilize the portal to track your current API usage against your rate limits

### Rigorous Testing

The final and most critical step is to perform comprehensive testing in an environment that mirrors your production setup as closely as possible

- **Staging Environment**: Deploy your application to a staging environment that uses your API keys and infrastructure, but is isolated from real users
- **End to End Testing**: Conduct thorough end to end tests covering all critical user flows:

  - Happy Paths: Ensure all core functionalities (swaps, bridging, lending, etc) work as expected
  - Edge Cases: Test with minimum, maximum values, unsupported tokens, low liquidity scenarios and various network conditions
  - Error Handling: Verify that your application gracefully handles API errors, network issues and transaction failures

- **Load and Stress Testing**: Simulate peak user traffic to ensure your application and its integration can handle the expected load without performance degradation or errors
- **Monitor Testing**: Verify that your logging, monitoring, and alerting systems are functioning correctly during these tests
- **Rollback Plan**: Have a clear rollback strategy in place in case any unforeseen issues arise during or after launch
