To maximize the performance, security and reliability of your application when integrating with GlueX, we recommend adhering to the following best practices

## Key Management and Security

Secure handling of your API keys is paramount to protect your application and users

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Never Hardcode API Keys">
    Store your API keys in environment variables or a secure secret management
    service (eg: AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager, HashiCorp
    Vault, Kubernetes Secrets). Avoid committing them directly into your source
    code, especially in public repositories
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Dedicated Keys">
    Always use separate API keys for development, staging and production
    environments. This limits the blast radius in case a key is compromised
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Restrict Access (Principle of Least Privilege)">
    Grant access to API keys only to the necessary applications and personnel.
    Utilize the IP whitelisting or domain whitelisting feature for your API keys
    to restrict where your keys can be used
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate Keys Periodically">
    Implement a routine for periodically rotating your API keys to minimize the
    risk associated with long lived credentials
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor API Key Usage">
    Keep an eye on your API key usage statistics in the GlueX portal to detect
    any unusual activity or surges
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Error Handling and Resiliency

Building a resilient application means anticipating and gracefully handling potential failures

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error Handling">
    Always check the response for errors from the API calls. Do not assume
    success. Log error codes and messages for debugging
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff">
    For transient network issues or rate limit (`429 Too Many Requests`) errors,
    implement retry logic. Use an exponential backoff strategy (eg: wait 1s,
    then 2s, then 4s, etc, with a maximum number of retries) to avoid
    overwhelming the API and allow it to recover
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handle Insufficient Tokens/Approvals">
    For transaction-related APIs (like Router), ensure your application checks
    for sufficient user token balances and necessary ERC20 token approvals
    *before* attempting a transaction. Provide clear feedback to the user if
    these prerequisites are not met
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="User Friendly Error Messages">
    Translate technical API error messages into clear, actionable and user
    friendly messages for your end users
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fallback Mechanisms">
    Consider implementing fallback mechanisms for critical operations if the API
    is temporarily unavailable or returns an unexpected error
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance and Efficiency

Optimize your integration for speed and resource utilization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Batch Requests">
    For APIs that support it (eg: Exchange Rates API allows up to 25 pairs per
    call), batch multiple requests into a single API call to reduce network
    overhead and improve efficiency
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cache Data Strategically">
    Cache static or infrequently changing data (eg: supported chains, token
    lists) on your application's side to reduce redundant API calls. Implement
    appropriate cache invalidation strategies
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Optimize API Calls">
    Only request the data you need. If an API allows for partial responses or
    specific field selection, use it to minimize data transfer size
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preflight Checks for Transactions">
    Before prompting a user to sign a transaction, use the price's simulation
    capabilities to estimate gas, check for potential errors (eg: slippage,
    insufficient liquidity), and provide an accurate preview to the user
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## User Experience and Transparency

A good user experience builds trust and encourages adoption

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Provide Clear Transaction Details">
    For any operation involving onchain transactions, clearly display all
    relevant details to the user before they confirm: input/output tokens,
    amounts, estimated gas fees, estimated slippage and the destination
    chain/address
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Realtime Feedback">
    Offer realtime feedback on transaction status (pending, confirmed, failed)
    and update UI elements accordingly
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Gas Fee Transparency">
    Always inform users about estimated gas fees upfront. Allow users to
    potentially adjust gas settings if your application supports it
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Slippage Control">
    If using swap or routing features, provide users with the option to set
    their preferred slippage tolerance, and clearly warn them if the estimated
    slippage is high
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Explain Complexities">
    For multi-step operations or novel DeFi interactions (eg: vault entries,
    staking), provide clear explanations or tooltips to help users understand
    what's happening
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security

Beyond API key security, ensure your overall application adheres to security best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Input Validation">
    Always validate and sanitize all user inputs before sending them to GlueX
    APIs. This helps prevent injection attacks and unexpected behavior
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Protect Private Keys">
    If your application handles private keys (eg: backend signing), ensure they
    are stored and used in a highly secure, isolated environment (eg: Hardware
    Security Module (HSM), secure enclaves)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular Security Audits">
    Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of your application,
    especially before major releases or after significant architectural changes
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stay Updated">
    Keep your GlueX SDKs, libraries and dependencies up to date to benefit from
    the latest features, performance improvements and security patches
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Compliance">
    Understand and adhere to any relevant regulatory compliance requirements
    (eg: KYC/AML for specific use cases) that might apply to your application's
    operations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring and Logging

Robust monitoring and logging are your eyes and ears in production

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Logging">
    Log all the requests and responses, including timings, status codes and
    relevant request/response bodies. This is invaluable for debugging and post
    mortem analysis
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Structured Logging">
    Use structured logging (eg: JSON logs) for easier parsing and analysis by
    automated tools
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Alerting">
    Set up alerts for critical metrics: 
    - High error rates (eg: 5xx responses, transaction failures) 
    - API rate limit nearly exhausted 
    - Unexpected latency spikes 
    - Discrepancies in data (eg: prices, balances)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deployment

Streamline your development process for efficiency and reliability

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Automated Testing">
    Implement unit, integration and end to end tests for your integration to
    catch regressions early and ensure correct functionality
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CI/CD Pipelines">
    Utilize Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines to automate
    testing, building and deployment, ensuring consistent and reliable releases
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Staging Environment">
    Maintain a dedicated staging environment that mirrors your production setup
    for final testing before deployment to live users
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
