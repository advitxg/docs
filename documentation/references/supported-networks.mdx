At GlueX, our mission is to provide the most efficient and comprehensive decentralized trading experience possible.
A core part of this mission is supporting a wide array of blockchain networks, allowing you to access fragmented liquidity
and execute trades across diverse ecosystems from a single interface

We continuously evaluate and integrate new networks based on their liquidity, user activity, technological advancements and community demand.
Our focus is primarily on EVM compatible chains due to their broad adoption in DeFi, but we will soon explore and integrate key non EVM chains where significant liquidity
and innovative protocols reside
