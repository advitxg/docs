The `GluexRouter` smart contract (version 1) facilitates secure and efficient execution of complex DeFi operations. It provides versatile functionality for routing tokens, collecting protocol fees and executing diverse onchain interactions via a structured interface. The contract prioritizes high security and usability, ensuring strict adherence to predefined routing and slippage rules

### Deployment

The `GluexRouter-v1` contract is deployed at the following address on the [supported chains](/documentation/references/supported-networks) by GlueX:

**Contract Address**: `0x6Ec7612828B776cC746fe0Ee5381CC93878844f7`

### Functions

#### Swap

Executes a token routing operation using a specified `IExecutor` contract and predefined interaction data. This function is the primary entry point for orchestrating multi-step DeFi flows

**Function Signature**

```solidity
function swap(
    IExecutor executor,
    RouteDescription calldata desc,
    Interaction[] calldata interactions,
    uint256 deadline
) external payable returns (uint256 finalOutputAmount);
```

**Parameters**

- `executor` (IExecutor): The executor contract performing the interactions
- `desc` (RouteDescription calldata): The route description containing input, output and fee details
- `interactions` (Interaction[] calldata): The interactions encoded for execution by the executor
- `deadline` (uint256): The timestamp after which the transaction will revert

**Returns**

- `finalOutputAmount` (uint256): The final amount of output token received

**Reverts**

- `Deadline passed`: If the block timestamp exceeds the deadline
- `Routing fee too high`: If `desc.routingFee` exceeds \_MAX_FEE
- `Routing fee too low`: If `desc.routingFee` is below \_MIN_FEE
- `Negative slippage limit`: If `desc.minOutputAmount` is less than or equal to zero
- `Slippage limit too large`: If `desc.minOutputAmount` exceeds `desc.outputAmount`

### Events

#### Routed

Emitted upon the successful completion of a token routing operation

**Event Signature**

```solidity
event Routed(
    bytes indexed uniquePID,
    address indexed userAddress,
    address outputReceiver,
    IERC20 inputToken,
    uint256 inputAmount,
    IERC20 outputToken,
    uint256 outputAmount,
    uint256 partnerFee,
    uint256 routingFee,
    uint256 finalOutputAmount
);
```

**Parameters**

- `uniquePID` (bytes): The unique identifier (integrator id) for the partner
- `userAddress` (address): The address of the user who initiated the route
- `outputReceiver` (address): The address of the receiver of the output token
- `inputToken` (IERC20): The ERC20 token used as input
- `inputAmount` (uint256): The amount of input token used for routing
- `outputToken` (IERC20): The ERC20 token received as output
- `outputAmount` (uint256): The expected output amount from the route
- `partnerFee` (uint256): The fee charged for the partner
- `routingFee` (uint256): The fee charged for the routing operation
- `finalOutputAmount` (uint256): The actual output amount received after routing
