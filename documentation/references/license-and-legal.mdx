## Key Legal Considerations

When building with or integrating GlueX APIs, UI Components or contributing to the protocol, keep the following important legal points in mind:

- **License Scope and Limitations:**
  The licenses granted for our APIs, UI Components and open source code are generally limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable.
  They do not permit sublicensing or resale of direct access without explicit prior written consent

- **Usage Restrictions:**
  There are specific prohibitions against actions such as reverse engineering, decompiling, creating competing services, circumventing security measures
  or engaging in any activities that could disrupt GlueX's services or violate applicable laws. Your use must always be for lawful purposes

- **Open-Source Contribution (Self-Integration):**
  While our core code is open-source (typically MIT/Apache license), contributions to the [GlueX Liquidity Module Self-Integration Repository](https://github.com/gluexprotocol/liquidity-module-self-integration)
  are subject to the terms of that repository

- **End-User Agreements:**
  If your application or service integrates GlueX functionalities for your end users, you are responsible for ensuring your own terms of service
  and privacy policy adequately inform your users and protect GlueX's rights and interests as a third party service provider

- **Ownership and Intellectual Property:**
  GlueX retains all rights, titles, and interests in its platform, APIs, UI Components, content, trademarks, logos and proprietary technology.
  Your license to use these does not transfer any ownership to you

- **Data Privacy Compliance:**
  When using GlueX APIs or the Widget, certain transaction logs, IP addresses and usage metrics may be collected and processed by GlueX as outlined in our Privacy Policy.
  You must also ensure that your own collection and handling of user data comply with all applicable data protection laws (eg: GDPR, CCPA)

- **Regulatory & Sanctions Compliance:**
  You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of GlueX Services complies with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction,
  including but not limited to anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) and sanctions compliance (eg: OFAC, EU, UN restrictions)

- **No Warranties & Assumption of Risk:**
  GlueX Services (APIs, Widget, Protocol) are provided "as-is" and "as-available." We offer no warranties regarding uninterrupted operation, freedom from errors, or accuracy.
  You acknowledge and accept the inherent risks of decentralized financial transactions, including smart contract vulnerabilities, market volatility
  and the irreversibility of blockchain transactions. GlueX is not liable for indirect or consequential damages
