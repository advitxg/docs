## Portal Tour

### API Key Management

When you log in for the first time (or, if you haven’t generated any API keys yet), the API Key Management section will display an empty state with instructions and an option to generate your **first API key**

<img
  className="rounded max-h-[480px]"
  src="/images/products/portal/api-management-empty.png"
  alt="Developer Portal - Empty"
/>

After generating an API key, you’ll be able to view and copy both your **API key** and your unique **Integrator ID**. The Integrator ID is essential for tracking analytics, usage, and associating requests with your account

  alt="Developer Portal - With Key"
/>

Use the copy buttons next to each field to quickly copy your API key and Integrator ID

**Best Practices**

- Store your API keys securely and never share them publicly
- Rotate or delete unused keys regularly to minimize risk
- Use descriptive names for each key to keep your integrations organized
- Monitor usage and set up alerts for unusual activity (feature coming soon)

#### Rotating an API Key

If you need to update your API key for security reasons or suspect it has been compromised, click **Rotate** next to the key. This will instantly invalidate the old key and generate a new one

> For best security, rotate your API key periodically

<Note>
  Only `basic` plan keys can be rotated. If you are a power user, please reach
  out to support for assistance
</Note>

#### Deleting an API Key

To permanently remove an API key, click **Delete**. This action cannot be undone, and any applications using the deleted key will lose access immediately

<Note>
  Only `basic` plan keys can be deleted. If you are a power user, please reach
  out to support for assistance
</Note>
