## Overview

This tutorial shows you how to get a list of all supported blockchains using the GlueX Exchange Rates API.

## Step 1: Make the Request

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X GET "https://exchange-rates.gluex.xyz/chains"
```

### Using Python

```python
import requests
url = "https://exchange-rates.gluex.xyz/chains"
response = requests.get(url)
print(response.json())
```

## Step 2: Handle the Response

The response will look like this:

```json
{
  "chains": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Ethereum", "blockchain_id": "ethereum" },
    { "id": 56, "name": "Binance Smart Chain", "blockchain_id": "bnb" },
    { "id": 137, "name": "Polygon", "blockchain_id": "polygon" }
  ]
}
```

You can now display or use the supported chains in your application.
