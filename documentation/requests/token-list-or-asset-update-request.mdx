Welcome to our guide for updating token information and managing assets on GlueX.
While GlueX generally indexes a vast array of tokens via public token lists, there are instances where specific token data might be missing, incorrect or require updates
(eg: logo updates, name changes or deprecation)

This guide is for projects and users who need to:

- Add a missing asset (like a token logo or detailed name)
- Correct existing token information
- Request the deprecation or update of an old token address (eg: due to a token migration)

## How to Request a Token Information Update

To ensure accuracy and timely processing, please submit your request through our dedicated channels:

### Add a new Token

If your token is not already listed, please:

... Dedicated form with necessary details like CA, Name, Symbol, Chains, Documentation ...

### For Missing Assets (Logos, Names, Symbols) or Corrections

If your token is already listed, but has incorrect information or is missing assets like its logo, please:

... Dedicated form with correction details ...

### For Token Deprecations or Address Changes:

For sensitive updates like deprecating an old token address (eg: due to a token migration or smart contract upgrade), please:

- Reach out to our team via ...
- Provide clear details on the old and new token addresses (if applicable)
- Explain the reason for deprecation (eg: token migration, contract abandonment)
- Share official announcements or documentation from the project confirming the change

## Important Notes

- **Public Token Lists**: GlueX primarily sources token data from reputable public token lists. If your token's information is incorrect or missing on these widely used lists, addressing it there first (eg: via Uniswap's token lists, CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap) can expedite the update process on GlueX
- **Verification**: All requests are subject to verification by the team to ensure accuracy and prevent malicious updates. We may reach out for further clarification
- **Prioritization**: Updates are processed based on the impact, volume and clarity of the request. Critical corrections or widely used tokens may be prioritized

We appreciate your diligence in helping us maintain the most accurate and comprehensive token data on GlueX!
