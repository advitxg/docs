The GlueX Protocol thrives on expanding its reach across the multi chain decentralized finance landscape.
We are continuously working to integrate new networks, layer 2 solutions and testnets to provide users with
the broadest possible liquidity access and the most efficient trading experience

If you have a specific blockchain network or layer 2 you believe GlueX should support, we welcome your requests!
This guide outlines the process for suggesting and potentially accelerating the integration of a new chain into the GlueX ecosystem

**How new Chains are Prioritized**

GlueX employs a data driven and community focused approach to prioritize new chain integrations. Chains are assessed based on factors such as:

- **Trade Volume**: The overall daily or weekly trading activity on the network
- **Total Value Locked (TVL)**: The amount of assets locked in DeFi protocols on the chain
- **Number of Protocols**: The richness of the ecosystem and variety of liquidity sources available
- **User Base**: The size and growth of the active user community
- **Technological Alignment**: Compatibility with our existing infrastructure (currently prioritizing EVM compatible chains than non EVM)
- **Community Demand**: Explicit requests and interest from our users and partners
- **Strategic Importance**: Emerging chains or those with unique features that offer significant value to the GlueX ecosystem
