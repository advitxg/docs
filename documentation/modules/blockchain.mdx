## Overview

GlueX Blockchain Modules are specialized components designed to streamline the onboarding and integration process of
different blockchains into the GlueX Protocol. These modules abstract blockchain level differences, providing a unified
interface for interacting with various blockchains. By leveraging these modules, GlueX ensures seamless compatibility
and reduces the complexity associated with supporting multiple chains with differing architectures, consensus
mechanisms and operational nuances

## Integrating a Blockchain Module

### Required Interfaces

#### Blockchain Node Access

- **Requirement:** Access to a fully synced blockchain node or a reliable third party RPC endpoint to interact with
  the target blockchain network
- **Purpose:** To enable API calls for querying the blockchain and submitting transactions

#### Blockchain specific SDK or Libraries

- **Requirement:** Include any required SDKs, libraries or APIs specific to the target blockchain (eg: web3 for
  Ethereum, cosmosSDK for cosmos chains)
- **Purpose:** Facilitate low level communication and transaction creation

#### Chain Configuration

- **Requirement:**
  - Chain ID and network details (mainnet/testnet)
  - Native token information (eg: gas currency)
  - Gas fee estimation logic specific to the chain
- **Purpose:** Configure the GlueX Protocol to understand chain specific properties

#### Implementation of Default Functionalities\*

- **Requirement:**
  - Multicall for efficient batching of read operations
  - Fetching token balances of specific addresses
  - Calculating computation cost and factor to ensure transaction validity
  - Estimating gas (transaction cost) for blockchain operations
  - Signing transactions securely and efficiently
- **Purpose:** Abstraction of default functional requirements for Gluex Protocol to interact with different
  blockchains

#### Error Handling and Fallbacks

- **Requirement:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to account for chain-specific quirks or downtime (eg:
  transaction reverts, RPC errors)
- **Purpose:** Maintain reliability and uptime in multi chain operations

#### Abstracting Blockchain Differences

- **Requirement:** Develop chain specific logic to abstract differences in:
  - Consensus algorithms (eg: Proof-of-Stake vs Proof-of-Work).
  - Transaction formats and metadata
  - Gas fee structures and dynamic adjustments
- **Purpose:** Provide a unified GlueX interface to interact with different blockchains seamlessly

  With these steps and requirements met, GlueX Blockchain Modules can provide
  robust and efficient integration, allowing the GlueX Protocol to operate
  across various blockchain ecosystems
