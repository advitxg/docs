## Overview

A GlueX Intent Module represents a high level abstraction designed to manage and execute specific user defined intents
across blockchains. An intent represents a high level goal, such as executing a token swap, placing a limit order, or
managing cross chain transactions. This module encapsulates all logic required to achieve the desired outcomes
efficiently, including search space generation, state management and optimization

### Key Features

1. **Modular Design**:Each intent module is self contained and tailored for a specific type of task, such as swaps or limit orders. This
   modularity ensures flexibility, ease of maintenance and scalability for the GlueX framework

2. **Blockchain Agnosticism**: Intent modules are designed to operate seamlessly across different blockchains. They can handle both native and wrapped
   tokens, allowing users to interact with multiple ecosystems without manual adjustments

3. **Optimization and Cost Efficiency**: GlueX Intent modules users advanced optimization algorithms to:

   - Balance execution costs (eg: gas fees) and benefits
   - Select the best execution paths based on real time conditions, such as liquidity and token prices

4. **Dynamic State Management**: The modules track and transition between various states during execution. This includes:

   - Tracking token balances
   - Maintaining execution maps and search spaces
   - Managing dependencies for accurate and efficient execution
