GlueX widget comes in two variants - **compact** and **drawer**. Variants allow customization of the exterior of the widget, like the presenting as a drawer. There are also several subvariants that helps to customize the interior look and feel as well as functionality

## Variant

Choose how the widget is presented on your page - a compact overlay for minimal footprint or a sliding drawer for a richer, side panel experience

| Property   | Type                  | Default   | Notes |
| ---------- | --------------------- | --------- | ----- |
| variant    | "compact" \| "drawer" | "compact" |       |
| subvariant | "router" \| "earn"    | "router"  |       |

  around with variants
</Note>

To use one of the variants, set the variant option in the widget configuration

```ts
const config = {
  // either of "compact" or "drawer"
  variant: "drawer",

  // either of "router" or "earn"
  subvariant: "router",
};
```

### Compact (Default)

The compact variant is ideal for scenarios where screen real estate is limited, such as smaller screens or integrated sections of your web application. It provides all essential functionalities in a condensed view, allowing easy embedding anywhere on your page

<img
  className="rounded"
  src="/images/products/widget/image/compact.png"
  alt="widget variant - compact"
/>

To use the **compact** variant, set the variant option in the widget configuration

```ts
const config = {
  // .. rest of the configuration ..
  variant: "compact",
};
```

### Drawer

The drawer variant presents the widget as a sliding side panel, offering a richer user experience. It can be dynamically shown or hidden based on user interaction and maintains the same layout as the compact variant

<img
  className="rounded"
  src="/images/products/widget/image/drawer.png"
  alt="widget variant - drawer"
/>

To use the **drawer** variant, set the variant option in the widget configuration

```ts
const config = {
  // .. rest of the configuration ..
  variant: "drawer",
};
```

**How do we control the drawer?**

The drawer doesnâ€™t have a pre built button to open and close it. To control the drawer you need to create and assign a `ref` to the widget

Here is an example of controlling the drawer with ref:

```typescript
export const WidgetPage = () => {
  const drawerRef = useRef<WidgetDrawer>(null);

  const toggleWidget = () => {
    drawerRef.current.toggleDrawer();
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={toggleWidget}>Open Widget</button>
      <GlueXWidget
        ref={drawerRef}
        config={{
          /* .. rest of the config .. */
          variant: "drawer",
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

## Sub Variant

Subvariants enable you to present different workflows or specialized functionalities to your users within the widget

To use a specific subvariant, simply set the subvariant option in your widget configuration

```typescript
const config = {
  variant: "compact",
  subvariant: "router",
};
```

### Router (Default)

The "router" (or default) subvariant provides the standard routing functionality in a compact view, allowing users to perform swaps or other core operations and is suitable for general purpose use

To use the **router** variant, set the subvariant option in the widget configuration

```ts
const config = {
  // .. rest of the configuration ..
  subvariant: "router",
};
```
