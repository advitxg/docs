The GlueX Widget provides a comprehensive event system through the `useWidgetEvents` hook that allows you to subscribe to various widget events.
This enables users to track swap progress, monitor quote execution, observe chain and token selections, track UI interactions and more

## Setup

First, import the necessary types and hooks:

```tsx
import { WidgetEvent, useWidgetEvents, type Route, type RouteExecutionUpdate } from "@gluex/widget";

export const WidgetEvents = () => {
  const widgetEvents = useWidgetEvents();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Event handlers for route execution
    const onRouteExecutionStarted = (route: Route) => {
      // Handle route start
    };

    const onRouteExecutionUpdated = (update: RouteExecutionUpdate) => {
      // Handle route updates
    };

    const onRouteExecutionCompleted = (route: Route) => {
      // Handle route completion
    };
    
    const onRouteExecutionFailed = (update: RouteExecutionUpdate) => {
      // Handle route failure
    };

    // Subscribe to events
    widgetEvents.on(WidgetEvent.RouteExecutionStarted, onRouteExecutionStarted);
    widgetEvents.on(WidgetEvent.RouteExecutionUpdated, onRouteExecutionUpdated);
    widgetEvents.on(WidgetEvent.RouteExecutionCompleted, onRouteExecutionCompleted);
    widgetEvents.on(WidgetEvent.RouteExecutionFailed, onRouteExecutionFailed);

    // Cleanup subscriptions
    return () => widgetEvents.all.clear();
  }, [widgetEvents]);

  return null;
};
```

## Available Events

The widget emits various events that you can listen to:

```tsx
enum WidgetEvent {
  // Route Events
  RouteExecutionStarted = "routeExecutionStarted"     // When a route starts executing
  RouteExecutionUpdated = "routeExecutionUpdated"     // Progress updates during execution
  RouteExecutionCompleted = "routeExecutionCompleted" // When route completes successfully
  RouteExecutionFailed = "routeExecutionFailed"       // When route execution fails
  RouteHighValueLoss = "routeHighValueLoss"           // High value loss detection
  RouteSelected = "routeSelected"                     // When a route is selected

  // Chain and Token Events
  SourceChainTokenSelected = "sourceChainTokenSelected"
  DestinationChainTokenSelected = "destinationChainTokenSelected"

  // Wallet Events
  WalletConnected = "walletConnected"
  SendToWalletToggled = "sendToWalletToggled"

  // UI and Form Events
  PageEntered = "pageEntered"
  WidgetExpanded = "widgetExpanded"
  FormFieldChanged = "formFieldChanged"
  SettingUpdated = "settingUpdated"
  TokenSearch = "tokenSearch"
  TransactionError = "transactionError"
}
```
