description: "Transparent and fair Router API fees at GlueX"
---

At GlueX, **transparency and fairness** are core to our philosophy. Our Router API is designed not only for optimal trade execution, but also with a fee model that aligns the incentives of users, integrators, and the protocol itself

We apply a **settlement fee** to all trades, which varies based on the pair type: **0.15% for volatile pairs** and **0.03% for stable pairs**. This fee is shared between GlueX and the integrator. In addition, we implement a flexible **positive slippage sharing**, **partner fee configuration**, and a **surplus sharing mechanism** to ensure equitable outcomes for all parties

## Settlement Fees

GlueX applies a minor settlement fee on every trade executed through the Router API. This fee is shared between GlueX and the integrator.

**Fee Structure:**
- **0.15% (15 bps)** on volatile pairs and custom assets
- **0.03% (3 bps)** on stablecoin swaps

> **Note**: Settlement fees can be adjusted based on the expected volume the integrator may drive to GlueX or any other considerations the GlueX team may find important to define a different fee schedule. Please contact us to discuss custom fee arrangements for enterprises.

**Key Details:**
- **Minimum floor**: 0.2c per trade, split equally between GlueX (0.1c) and integrator (0.1c)
- **Revenue sharing**: Settlement fees are split equally between GlueX and the integrator
- **No hidden costs**: What you quote is what the user gets — with all fees accounted for transparently in the returned values

## Partner Fee Model

To help integrators monetize their services, GlueX supports a configurable **partner fee mechanism** that allows a portion of the output amount to be automatically redirected to a designated wallet

### Configuration

```json
{
  // ... other parameters
  "partnerFee": "<bps_of_output_amount>",
  "partnerAddress": "<0x_partner_wallet_address>"
}
```

- `partnerFee`: Basis points (bps) applied to the output amount, deducted before final output.
- `partnerAddress`: Wallet address where partner fees are sent.

### How It Works

Partner fees are factored into both `minOutputAmount` and `effectiveOutputAmount`. Once the trade is executed on-chain, the fee amount is automatically transferred to your `partnerAddress`.

## Surplus Rebates

“**Surplus**” refers to the added value when GlueX’s routing achieves **better-than-benchmark** execution (e.g., compared to next best aggregator's market rate). This can result from:

- **Optimized routing paths** across liquidity sources
- **Gas savings** via efficient transaction design
- **Proprietary internal methods**
- **Exclusive liquidity partnerships**

### Surplus Distribution

| Recipient  | Share of Surplus |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| User       | < 33%            |
| Integrator | ≤ 33%            |
| GlueX      | ≤ 33%            |

### Activation

To receive your share of surplus rewards:

```json
{
  // ... other parameters
  "activateSurplusFee": true,
  "partnerAddress": "<0x_partner_wallet_address>"
}
```

> When `activateSurplusFee` is enabled, specialized contracts handle the fair distribution of captured surplus, ensuring your `partnerAddress` receives its portion automatically.

## Positive Slippage Rebates

When trades execute better than quoted (i.e., **positive slippage exists**), GlueX ensures that this extra value is **fairly distributed** between the user, the integrator, and the protocol - in the same ratio as the surplus.

### Distribution

- **User**: Gets the primary share of the extra output.
- **Integrator**: Rewarded for brinding orderflow and optimizing experience.
- **GlueX**: Retains a portion to support protocol growth and sustainability.

This transparent, win-win-win mechanism fosters long-term trust and collaboration across all stakeholders.
