title: "Fee Structure"
description: ""
---

At GlueX, transparency and fairness are our core values. The Router API is engineered to provide not just optimal trade execution, but also a clear and equitable fee structure that aligns incentives across users, integrators and the protocol itself. Unlike traditional models, we impose **no direct routing fees** and innovatively distribute any **positive slippage**, alongside a flexible partner fee model and advanced surplus sharing mechanism

## Zero Routing Fees

We believe in maximizing value for the end user. That's why we proudly charge **absolutely zero routing fees** for any swap executed through our Router API, with no hidden markups or backend commissions embedded in the trade execution

### Highlights

- **0% routing fees:** Your users will never pay a direct fee to the protocol for facilitating their swaps
- **No hidden costs or surcharges:** The price you quote is the price your user gets, free from unexpected deductions
- **User first pricing execution:** Our model ensures that every transaction is executed with the user's best interest, optimizing for the greatest possible output without additional costs

## Partner Fee Model

GlueX empowers integrators and partners to build sustainable businesses by enabling them to monetize their valuable contribution to the DeFi ecosystem. Our configurable partner fee mechanism allows you to define a fee that is integrated into the trade. This is done via two fields in the request:

### Configuration

```json
{
  // ... other parameters
  "partnerFee": <bps_of_output_amount>,
  "partnerAddress": "<0x_partner_wallet_address>"
}
```

- `partnerFee`: Fee in basis points (bps) applied to the output amount (this fee is automatically deducted from the user's final output)
- `partnerAddress`: EOA address to receive the collected fee

These fees are automatically accounted for in the returned output amount and transferred accordingly

### How It Works

Once configured, these fees are automatically accounted for in the `minOutputAmount` and `effectiveOutputAmount` returned by the API. Upon successful onchain execution, the specified `partnerFee` amount is automatically transferred to your `partnerAddress`, ensuring a smooth and automated monetization stream for your integration

## Positive Slippage Rewards

In dynamic decentralized markets, trades can sometimes execute at a more favorable rate than initially quoted (ie. the user receives more output tokens than expected). This "positive slippage" means the user receives more output tokens than they initially expected and at GlueX, we ensure that the entire difference is distributed to the user, partner and the protocol. This enhances transparency and builds trust with integrators and users alike

### Commitment to Fairness

If a swap results in "positive slippage", GlueX ensures that this entire difference is transparently distributed. This distribution ensures a stronger ecosystem and builds trust with both our integrators and their end users. The positive slippage is divided among:

- **End Users**: Receives the primary benefit, ensuring they get the best possible outcome from their trade
- **Partner or Integrator**: You, as the integrator, are incentivized for bringing the user and optimizing their experience
- **Protocol**: A portion is allocated to the protocol, supporting ongoing protocol development, maintenance and innovation, all without charging direct routing fees

This mechanism not only enhances transparency but also creates a win-win-win scenario for all participants, directly aligning our success with yours and your users' benefit

## Surplus Sharing (Advanced)

**Surplus** refers to the additional value captured when GlueX's advanced routing engine significantly outperforms other routers or expected trade benchmarks (market expectations). Surplus arises from:

- **Better routing decisions**: Our highly optimized algorithms identify the most efficient and least fragmented paths across various liquidity sources
- **Gas optimizations**: Intelligent transaction structuring and execution to minimize on-chain gas costs, effectively leading to more net output for the user
- **Internal execution advantages**: Proprietary methods and designs that allow GlueX to achieve better execution than standard market operations
- **Preferential pool pricing and Partnerships**: Through strategic agreements with certain liquidity protocols and market makers, GlueX may access exclusive pricing, reduced trading fees, or deeper liquidity that is not generally available to the public

When such a surplus is detected and captured, it is then intelligently shared to maximize benefits across the ecosystem

- **User** (receives maximum benefit)
- **Partner** (incentivized through integration)
- **GlueX** (for protocol development)

### Activation

To enable the advanced surplus sharing mechanism and allow your `partnerAddress` to receive its allocated share of this additional value, include the following in your API request

```json
{
  // ... other parameters
  "activateSurplusFee": true,
  "partnerAddress": "<0x_partner_wallet_address>"
}
```

<Note>
  Activating `activateSurplusFee` enables the use of specialized surplus fee
  contracts that handle the fair allocation and distribution of this captured
  value according to the agreed upon distribution model. Ensure your
  `partnerAddress` is correctly set up to receive these distributions
</Note>
