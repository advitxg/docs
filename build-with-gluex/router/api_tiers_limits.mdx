## Access Tiers

Each tier offers a specific request rate, burst capacity, and level of support.

| Tier       | RPS                       | Burst          | Intended Use Case                                        |
|------------|---------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Basic      | 3                         | 3              | Ideal for development, testing, and small-scale dApps     |
| Growth     | 10                        | 30             | Suitable for mid-sized production dApps and services      |
| Premium    | 20                        | 50             | Supports large-scale production and real-time operations  |
| Enterprise | Custom                    | Custom         | Tailored for exchanges, aggregators, or institutional use |


## How to Upgrade Your Tier

Partners may request an upgrade by contacting the [GlueX team](https://t.me/+_VmO_gIrNjxiZWE0). Higher tiers come with service-level agreements (SLAs), priority support, and custom integration guidance.

> **Note:** To ensure platform stability, GlueX enforces stricter rate limits on high-computation endpoints like `/v1/quote`. The `/v1/price` endpoint is designed to be used frequently for polling and should be the primary endpoint used in the frontend of dApps.
