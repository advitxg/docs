title: "API Endpoints"
description: "This section outlines the primary endpoints (fetch pricing estimates and generate transaction calldata) provided by the Router API"
---

The GlueX Router API provides a powerful and flexible interface for interacting with decentralized finance protocols. This section outlines the core endpoints you'll use to fetch real time pricing estimates and generate the necessary transaction calldata for seamless onchain execution

> **Note:**
> It is highly recommended to call the `price` endpoint before invoking the `quote` endpoint. This pattern is especially critical when building applications. The `price` endpoint can be polled periodically (eg: every few seconds) to provide users with realtime pricing information. Once the user approves the router contract and confirms the intention to swap, the `quote` endpoint should be called to retrieve the final calldata for onchain execution
>
> This architecture reduces unnecessary load on the quote infrastructure and ensures accurate, timely user interactions. Furthermore, GlueX plans to introduce market maker integrations on the `quote` endpoint, which will enhance price discovery and further optimize rate limits for this endpoint

## POST `/v1/price`

Returns a **price estimate** for a token swap. This endpoint is intended for off chain estimation and does not include calldata or simulation metadata

**Description**

- Provides estimated input/output amounts
- Supports partial fill logic

**Example Request**

```http
POST /v1/price
x-api-key: your-api-key
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body (Example)**

```json
{
  "chainID": "ethereum",
  "inputToken": "0x...",
  "outputToken": "0x...",
  "inputAmount": "100000000",
  "userAddress": "0x...",
  "outputReceiver": "0x...",
  "uniquePID": "partner-xyz"
}
```

## POST /v1/quote

Returns a **price quote** along with **transaction calldata** for executing the trade onchain

**Description**

- Includes all `price` endpoint fields
- Adds transaction-specific fields such as `calldata` and `revert`
- Simulation is enabled by default (`computeEstimate: true`)

**Example Request**

```http
POST /v1/quote
x-api-key: your-api-key
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body (Example)**

```json
{
  "chainID": "ethereum",
  "inputToken": "0x...",
  "outputToken": "0x...",
  "inputAmount": "100000000",
  "userAddress": "0x...",
  "outputReceiver": "0x...",
  "uniquePID": "partner-xyz",
  "computeEstimate": true
}
```

**Additional Response Fields for `quote`**

- `calldata`: ABI encoded transaction data
- `revert`: Boolean indicating if the trade would revert
- `computationUnits`: Estimated gas
- `lowBalance`: Indicates insufficient balance
- `blockNumber`: Block number for simulation context
- `simulation`: Raw trace/debug metadata
