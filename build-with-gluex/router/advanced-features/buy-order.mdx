While traditional swaps (often referred to as `SELL` orders) involve specifying the `inputAmount` and receiving a calculated `outputAmount`, the **Buy Order** functionality allows users to define their desired `outputAmount` of tokens, with the router calculating the required `inputAmount` to achieve that target. This provides greater flexibility for users focused on acquiring a specific amount of an asset

### How It Works

When orderType is set to `BUY`, the GlueX Router fundamentally reverses its calculation logic:

- **Input calculation**: Instead of starting with a fixed input, the router determines the minimum `inputAmount` (and thus `inputToken`) necessary to acquire the `outputAmount` specified by the user, taking into account current market rates, fees and slippage
- **Market buy optimization**: The routing engine optimizes the path to achieve the target outputAmount using the most cost effective `inputAmount` possible

This contrasts directly with the default `SELL` order behavior, where `inputAmount` is predefined, and the `outputAmount` is the calculated variable

### Configuration

To initiate a Buy Order, you must include the `orderType` and `outputAmount` parameters in your `/v1/price` or `/v1/quote` request payload:

```json
{
  // ... other parameters
  "orderType": "BUY",
  "outputAmount": "<desired_output_value>"
}
```

| `orderType` | Required Field | Description                       |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `BUY`       | `outputAmount` | Amount of output token to receive |
| `SELL`      | `inputAmount`  | Amount of input token to swap     |

<Note>
  If `orderType` is **not specified**, it defaults to `SELL`. In this case,
  `inputAmount` parameter becomes mandatory and `outputAmount` will be computed
  by the API
</Note>

### Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Caters directly to users who know exactly how much of a target token they wish to acquire
- **Simplified user flow**: For specific use cases (eg: buying a fixed amount of governance tokens), this simplifies the user experience by reducing mental calculation
- **Optimized input calculation**: The router automatically finds the most efficient way to achieve the desired `outputAmount`
