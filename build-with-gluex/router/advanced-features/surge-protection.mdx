**Surge Protection** is a built in pre trade safety mechanism designed to safeguard users from significant value loss during periods of shallow liquidity, extreme market volatility or abrupt price movements

### How It Works

Before executing a swap, the Router performs a rapid, hypothetical **reverse trade simulation**. This simulation instantaneously attempts to "sell back" the expected output token for the original input token, all within the context of the same block and without external market interference

- **Simulation logic:** The router uses the current onchain state to estimate how much of the original `inputToken` a user would recover if they immediately tried to reverse the trade
- **Threshold trigger:** If this estimated recovery amount falls below a predefined threshold (currently **90%** of the original `inputAmount`), the trade is deemed high risk and is automatically blocked by the router. This prevents the transaction from being broadcast onchain, saving the user from a potentially significant loss

### Evaluation Criteria

The Surge Protection mechanism evaluates a combination of factors to determine if a trade poses an unacceptable risk:

- **Liquidity depth:** Assesses the available liquidity on the chosen routing path. Extremely shallow liquidity can make trades highly susceptible to price swings
- **Price impact:** Analyzes the estimated price impact of the proposed trade on the affected liquidity pools
- **Volatility within the block:** Detects sudden and significant price changes occurring within the current blockchain block, often indicative of front-running attempts or market manipulation

### Default Threshold

If the estimated reverse loss exceeds **10%** (meaning the recovered amount would be less than 90% of the original input), the trade is halted, and the API returns a `revert: true` flag and the specific error causing the Surge Protection activation

### User Benefits

Implementing Surge Protection directly translates to a safer and more trustworthy experience for the end users:

- **Prevents sudden losses:** Acts as a shield against common DeFi pitfalls like front running (where malicious bots execute trades before and after a user's transaction to profit from price changes) or being the "exit liquidity" in illiquid pools
- **Avoids adverse market conditions:** Protects users from executing trades when liquidity is insufficient or prices are highly volatile, which could lead to substantial value erosion
- **Enhances trust and safety:** By proactively preventing potentially bad trades, Surge Protection significantly enhances user confidence in your application and on us!

### Configuration

Surge Protection is **disabled by default** to give integrators full control. You can enable it explicitly in your `/v1/quote` API request by setting the `surgeProtection` parameter to `true`:

```json
{
  // ... other parameters
  "surgeProtection": true
}
```

<Note>
  When enabled, any trade exceeding the 10% reverse loss threshold will cause
  the `/v1/quote` endpoint to return `revert: true` and will not provide
  executable calldata. Your application should gracefully handle this condition
  and inform the user
